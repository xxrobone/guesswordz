# GAMEZ - assignment 3 CME- frontend

Creating a game (games) using html, css and vanilla js or Jquery
I chose vanilla js, I just want to practise to get better

## Process, issues, thoughts

ItÂ´s been fun also challenging, redoing the assignment 2 which was a "hangman" console game to a dom game
Changed the name to word guess, not doing any hanging...
I also done a rock paper scissors
- fixed issue with my restart button, function was called inside
it instead of just resetting the values 

- Adding to win or losses on players progress works, but when i restart the round/ game session score point system is not 
resetting the values right and messes up second round

- Quit button works on both games, and reloads page, which resets everything.

- In the RPS game i added colors to console logs which was a nice thing, its easier to see and i see benefit of using this in the future
for bot when code is run successfully or error handling. :D

I try to make it semantic but it feels strange with a game, a lot of divs... div hell 

still creating separate css files for header, footer, nav, buttons makes some stuff easier
This would be much easier with a library (framework, not really) but REACT. I will use react 
and try to recreate both these games with react the coming months. 

I also seen the benefit of using something like Jquery, I have done exercises with jquery but decided to use Vanilla

I have some trouble concentrating and making 2 projects and flipping between them was a challenge
### The games page (demo)

I hope you (who ever sees this) like these classic games, feel free to try them out in their current state

## Responsivness

This page has been tested on 
- Samsung 10 and 22
- Iphone 5 and 7
- Ipad pro
- LG 55 oled (I mean why not with the tech today)

And works fine on all these devices, LG tv game some hickups on the animations.
