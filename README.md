# GAMEZ - assignment 3 CME- frontend

creating a game using html, css and vanilla js or Jquery
I chose vanilla js, I just want to practise to get better

## Process, issues, thoughts

ItÂ´s been fun also challenging, redoing the assignment 2 which was a "hangman" console game to a dom game
Changed the name to word guess, not doing any hanging...
I also done a rock paper scissors
- I stumbled on issues trying to create a restart functions button without
reloading the page, something is wrong on this at the moment, I might fix it (if i find the sollution today is thu 22 dec 2022)
- Adding to win or losses on players progress works, but when i restart the round/ game session score point system is not 
resetting the values right and messes up second round

- Quit button works on both games, and reloads page, which resets everything.

I try to make it semantic but it feels strange with a game, a lot of divs... div hell 

still creating separate css files for header, footer, nav, buttons makes some stuff easier
This would be much easier with a library (framework, not really) but REACT. I will use react 
and try to recreate both these games with react the coming months. 

I also seen the benefit of using something like Jquery, I have done exercises with jquery but decided to use Vanilla

I have some trouble concentrating and making 2 projects and flipping between them was a challenge
